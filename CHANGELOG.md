## Unreleased

### Added

- Added AWS Agent Registry as an independent assessment area with its own
  regional Lambda, Step Functions branch, CSV artifact, and HTML report area
  (including a dashboard summary tile and assessment-scope chip), plus an
  `AR-00` through `AR-08` check namespace covering IAM full access, IAM stale
  access, publication approval governance, discovery authorization,
  customer-managed KMS encryption, organization auto-detection, record
  lifecycle governance, and record provenance. Behavior worth knowing:
  - `AR-01` and `AR-02` evaluate attached and inline policies whose
    `Statement` is either a single object or a list. `AR-02` uses IAM
    service-last-accessed data: access older than 60 days fails, while IAM job
    errors and deadlines stay visible as indeterminate `N/A` rows.
  - Record inventory is bounded to 1,000 records and paginates within the
    Lambda deadline. A truncation or deadline notice is reported as an
    additional `N/A`/Informational row and does not discard the records
    already assessed.
  - Absent optional service metadata — approval configuration, discovery
    authorizer, auto-detection, creator attribution, and provenance source
    type — is reported as indeterminate `N/A` rather than as a failure, and an
    unrecognized authorizer type is reported as unsupported instead of as a
    reviewed JWT configuration. Auto-detected records must carry
    `DETECTED_FROM` lineage naming an AgentCore runtime or gateway matching
    the declared source type.
  - Discovery authorization and record lifecycle states are reported as
    informational evidence requiring review rather than as passes.
  - Registries in regions the account has not enabled are reported as
    unavailable, and client initialization or API failures become incomplete
    assessments with error-specific remediation. A single failing check
    produces an incomplete `N/A` row while the regional CSV is still written;
    an unrecoverable CSV-generation or S3-write failure raises so Step
    Functions records the failed task instead of treating a returned
    `statusCode: 500` payload as success.
- Added Agentic AI Security mappings `AG-33` through `AG-38`, derived from the
  new `AR-03` through `AR-08` controls. The catalog now contains 208 checks
  (94 core, 38 Agentic AI, 64 Responsible AI GRC, and 12 OWASP). Agent
  Registry findings are deliberately outside OWASP scope — the `AR-*` controls
  establish Registry governance but do not directly prove an OWASP
  LLM01–LLM10 control — so enabling OWASP does not change Registry counts.
- Added configurable `RequireAgentRegistryManualApproval` and
  `RequireAgentRegistryCMK` deployment baselines. Both are advisory by
  default, so a registry that auto-approves submitted records or uses the AWS
  owned encryption key is reported as informational, and remediation guidance
  is shown only when the baseline requires the control.
- Added SDK contract, IAM coverage, baseline-wiring, registry inventory,
  error-path, and finding-behavior tests, including pass/fail (or advisory
  `N/A`), no-resource, and access-denied coverage for `AR-01` and `AR-04`
  through `AR-07`.

### Changed

- Hardened assessment deployment roles. `AIMLSecurityMemberRole` now contains
  only cross-account deployment, Step Functions polling, and report-retrieval
  permissions; assessment APIs remain exclusively on the SAM-created Lambda
  execution roles. CodeBuild roles now scope Lambda, IAM, S3, and `PassRole`
  access to assessment resources, restrict `PassRole` to Lambda and Step
  Functions, remove stale Lambda/S3 administration actions, and no longer
  define unused local member roles. SAM runtime roles now use exact,
  prefix-scoped S3 artifact permissions instead of bucket-wide
  `S3CrudPolicy`, and remove stale IAM, SageMaker, GuardDuty, AgentCore, ECR,
  Logs, EC2, Lambda, ECS, CloudTrail, and S3 actions. The IAM permission-cache
  Lambda retains only the identity and policy reads it actually performs.
  Per-resource reads are ARN-scoped wherever the AWS service supports it;
  account-level enumeration APIs that do not support resource-level
  authorization (`bedrock:ListGuardrails`, `bedrock:ListPrompts`,
  `bedrock:ListAutomatedReasoningPolicies`, `sagemaker:ListPipelineExecutions`)
  remain on `Resource: "*"` so their checks are not silently denied.
  IAM service-last-access job creation is limited to roles and users in the
  assessed account using partition-aware principal ARNs, and AgentCore metric
  publication is constrained to the `AIMLSecurity/AgentCore` CloudWatch
  namespace.
- Standardized all AWS SDK dependencies on exact `boto3==1.43.85` and
  `botocore==1.43.85` pins.
- Narrowed `AC-02` wildcard findings and `AC-03` stale-access discovery to the
  `bedrock-agentcore` IAM namespace. Overly permissive `agent-registry` grants
  are now reported by `AR-01` and `AR-02`.
- Added end-user guidance for determining whether an upgrade requires only a
  CodeBuild run, a top-level infrastructure stack update, or a multi-account
  member-role StackSet update.
- Updated the screenshot capture tool to enforce the repository-root `.venv`,
  install its optional Python dependencies when missing, and verify a
  venv-local Playwright Chromium browser before capturing screenshots. Capture
  height now expands dynamically so every left-navigation section is visible.

### Fixed

- Restore CodeBuild and cross-account member-role access to start and poll the
  SAM-generated `AIMLAssessmentStateMachine-*` state machines. The
  least-privilege policies now explicitly include the generated state-machine
  and execution ARN patterns without widening access to unrelated workflows.
- Prevented `FS-22` from flagging assessment-created roles solely for Bedrock
  inventory APIs that AWS requires to use `Resource: "*"`. It still flags
  wildcard Bedrock actions and exact Knowledge Base actions that support ARN
  scoping but remain unscoped.
- Calculate report pass rates from unique direct-service controls instead of
  resource-row counts: any failed assessable row fails its `Check_ID`, controls
  pass only when all assessable rows pass, and N/A rows are excluded.
- Stop `AC-03` IAM last-access polling before the Lambda timeout, preserve
  completed results with an explicit incomplete-assessment row, and classify
  IAM job timeouts as indeterminate instead of failed controls.
- Require `AC-03` candidate permissions to come from attached or inline policy
  documents instead of inferring access from attached-policy names.
- Evaluate attached customer-managed IAM policy documents as well as inline
  policies in `AC-02` and `AC-03`, and score `Allow`/`NotAction` allow-except
  policies only when their exclusions name the AgentCore namespace without
  fully covering it, so an administrator-style grant is treated the same
  whether it is written as `Action: "*"` or as `NotAction`.
- Preserve case-insensitive IAM wildcard matching while supporting embedded and
  partial wildcard action patterns.
- Report AgentCore as unavailable in regions the account has not enabled. A
  missing regional endpoint and the credential-shaped codes AWS returns for a
  disabled region (`UnrecognizedClientException`, `InvalidClientTokenId`,
  `AuthFailure`) are classified as regional unavailability, so scanning all
  partition regions no longer produces per-region rows advising operators to
  troubleshoot DNS, VPC routing, or credentials. Genuinely expired or malformed
  credentials (`ExpiredToken`, `SignatureDoesNotMatch`) and other API failures
  remain incomplete assessments with credential- or error-specific
  remediation.
- Backfill deadline-skipped AgentCore and Agentic AI checks before writing the
  regional CSV so an approaching timeout no longer drops controls from the
  report.
- Make screenshot capture failures, including clipped-sidebar guard failures,
  terminate the capture tool with a non-zero exit status.

### Deployment impact

Apply these updates in order.

1. **Multi-account member-role StackSet update required first** because
   `deployment/1-aiml-security-member-roles.yaml` changed. It creates the
   member-role customer-managed deployment policy and narrows
   `AIMLSecurityMemberRole` to deployment, execution-polling, and
   report-retrieval operations; assessment service API permissions remain on
   SAM Lambda execution roles.
2. **Multi-account central infrastructure update required next** because
   `deployment/2-aiml-security-codebuild.yaml` changed with the AWS Agent
   Registry baselines and least-privilege CodeBuild deployment policy. This
   update also removes the obsolete conditional local member-role resource if
   an older stack still tracks it.
3. **Single-account infrastructure update required** because
   `deployment/aiml-security-single-account.yaml` changed with the same
   baselines and CodeBuild policy hardening. This update also removes the
   obsolete local member-role resource if an older stack still tracks it.
4. **CodeBuild run required last** to deploy the updated assessment code,
   dependencies, `buildspec.yml`, and AWS SAM templates
   (`aiml-security-assessment/template.yaml` and
   `aiml-security-assessment/template-multi-account.yaml`), which create the
   standalone AWS Agent Registry assessment Lambda and update the state
   machine.
